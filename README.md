# DoomIUT
I'm working on class project where I have to make the user visit my IUT. I choosed to present the IUT with a doom-like game

# Concept
<br><br>
The player is a student from the IUT.
Recently the IUT was infested by bugs, the student has been missioned by Mr. Darties to try debugging the entire school.
<br> And guess what, you have been choosen due to your excelent grades to exterminate the bugs of Beziers's IUT.
<br><br>
